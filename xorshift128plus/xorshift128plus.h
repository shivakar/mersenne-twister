/* This is the fastest generator passing BigCrush without
   systematic failures, but due to the relatively short period it is
   acceptable only for applications with a mild amount of parallelism;
   otherwise, use a xorshift1024* generator.

   The state must be seeded so that it is not everywhere zero. If you have
   a 64-bit seed, we suggest to seed a splitmix64 generator and use its
   output to fill s. */
